# Practice

# Brief Description

In this project, we are trying to practice some of the standard problems using different algorithms. The basic aim is to optimize the algorithm in consideration of constraints (that are not limited to small range).

We would like to invite all the visitors to help us contribute with better approach and comments on the same.


# Programming Language

The primary programming language will be Java, but we will try our best efforts to cover languages also. If you try to implement the solution in you preferred approach, we would request you to share the same.
