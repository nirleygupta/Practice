# This file is a basic readme for LowestCommonMulitple implementation.

We are trying to achieve LCM for numbers by using prime factorization technique.


Input Format
  n - No of numbers
  a1, a2 ..... an - Numbers

  1<=n<=10 power 9
  1<=a1*a2*.....an<=10 power 15
 
Output Format
  m - LCM of a1,a2.....an
  LCM of the product m would be displayed

Example

Sample Input 0
10
829 455 345 229 123 121 111 14 13 12

Sample Output 0
LCM of the above numbers is 4376041608398460
